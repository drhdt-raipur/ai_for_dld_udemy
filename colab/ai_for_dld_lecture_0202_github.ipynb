    "# Setting Up GitHub for HDL Projects and Colab Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìå Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will learn Verilog and VHDL using AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini. All activities will be performed on Google Colab. To save our notebooks, share progress, and build a professional portfolio, we will use **GitHub**.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a free, cloud-based platform widely used in the software and hardware industries to store, track, and collaborate on code. For HDL learners, it becomes a versioned portfolio of your journey‚Äîsomething you can showcase in interviews, resumes, and internships.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a GitHub account\n",
    "- Set up a new repository\n",
    "- Added a professional README in markdown\n",
    "- Created a `colab` branch to store your Colab notebooks\n",
